## Project Roadmap & Progression

### Phase 1: Basic CLI Chatbot
- Simple keyword-based chatbot with static responses
- Single-turn replies without memory or branching
- Sets creepy, atmospheric tone for the game

### Phase 2: Dialogue State Machine & Branching Narrative
- Loads dialogue scripts from JSON for flexible storytelling
- Tracks conversation state and stores player context (e.g., name)
- Supports branching dialogue paths based on user input options
- Safely formats dialogue with stored context variables
- Foundation for expanding into a full interactive horror experience

### Next Steps: Phase 3 (Upcoming)
- Improve input parsing and sanitization (e.g., extracting names)
- Add typing delays and glitch effects for atmosphere
- Incorporate dynamic and unsettling chatbot behavior
- Enhance narrative immersion with psychological horror elements
